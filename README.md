HippoADK


Due to the lack of support by HippoADK group, I am forking this project to try to add all info that is missing
Any help from user community is welcome. Also from developers :-)

List of Issues (ToDo's)
  1. Missing stm32 windows driver for downloading sketchs from Arduino IDE
  2. No installing instruction
  3. No circuit diagrams, no pinouts (HippoADK, HippoLego). 

1. Do not follow the instruction downloading arduino-1.5.5-master.zip, but clone the repository. There are few changes that are important. Install drivers of CP2102 F405 bridge.
